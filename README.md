# AI-Driven-Text-to-Speech-Chatbot-with-Flask-Integration-# AI-Driven Text-to-Speech Chatbot with Flask Integration

## Overview

The "AI-Driven Text-to-Speech Chatbot with Flask Integration" project aims to create an advanced, user-friendly chatbot that utilizes artificial intelligence to convert text inputs into natural-sounding speech. This project is designed to enhance customer interaction, streamline support services, and provide an exceptional user experience.

## Key Features

- **Text-to-Speech Conversion:** Converts text inputs into speech using the Google Text-to-Speech (gTTS) API, providing users with audible responses.
- **AI-Driven Responses:** Utilizes machine learning algorithms to understand and respond to user queries effectively.
- **Flask Integration:** Integrates with the Flask web framework to provide a robust backend, ensuring smooth and responsive user interactions.

## Technical Skills Required

1. **Python Programming:**
   - Strong coding skills in Python.
   - Familiarity with libraries like NumPy and Flask.

2. **Machine Learning:**
   - Experience with TensorFlow and Keras for developing and deploying models.

3. **Natural Language Processing (NLP):**
   - Knowledge of gTTS for converting text to speech.

4. **Web Development:**
   - Proficiency in Flask for backend development.
